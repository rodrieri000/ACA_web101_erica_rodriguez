              <p>Junkie (1953) and Queer (1951) were the famous aftermath of what can only be described as my self-made tragedy. Although I had written throughout the entirety of my life, it wasn’t until an extreme pivotal point in my life that I chose to publish and contribute to the building blocks of the legendary Beat Generation.</p> 
              <p>To date, Naked Lunch (1959) has sold over one million copies, and stands as the last obscenity trial against a work of literature. Originally banned from Boston and Los Angeles and prohibited from being distributed via USPS, its controversial notoriety fueled it to be the most influential book within the Beat Movement.</p> 
              <p>After creating the “cut up” writing style, I went on to published 16 books, 25 short stories and wrote countless letters and collections. I managed to live to the age of 83 while being a ‘functioning’ heroin and opioid addict. It's almost as if I could get away with murder.</p></small>
